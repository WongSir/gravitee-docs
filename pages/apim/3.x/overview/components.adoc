Next sections are describing top components which are part of Gravitee.io.

== API Gateway
The API Gateway is the core component of the Gravitee.io platform. You can compare it to a "smart" proxy to understand its goal.

Unlike traditional HTTP proxy, the gateway is able to apply <<apim_overview_plugins.adoc#gravitee-plugins-policies, policies>> (ie. rules) to
both HTTP requests and responses according to your needs, meaning that you can enhance requests and responses processing
by adding transformation, security, and many other crazy features!
